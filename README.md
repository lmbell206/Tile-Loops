Tile-Based Synthesizer and Sequencer

What does this project do?

This project is a synthesizer with sequencer. It utilizes tiles to structure the sequences. The basic idea is that height defines pitch (taller=lower), length defines duration (longer=longer), and position defines timing (sequence moves from left to right).

It is for making any kinds of sound sequences.

Why is this project useful?

It's fun and can be used for a variety of musical and soundtrack purposes.
