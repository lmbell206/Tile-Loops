# Tile Loops
 Tile-Based Synthesizer and Sequencer


 What does this project do?

This project is a synthesizer with sequencer.  It utilizes tiles to structure the sequences.  The basic idea is that height defines pitch (taller=lower), length defines duration (longer=longer), and position defines timing (sequence moves from left to right).

It is for making any kinds of sound sequences.  


Why is this project useful?

It's fun and can be used for a variety of musical and soundtrack purposes.


How do I get started?

Take a look at the code and try to figure out how it works.  I work on it in my spare time and am learning as I go.  I'm sure it has some wonky or inefficient parts, but somehow I got it to work.  I hope to eventually document the components of the code and clearly define how to add additional sound banks or features.

Where can I get more help, if I need it?

E-mail me at landonbell206@outlook.com if you have questions or ideas.  This is a hobby project for me, and I've pushed my coding-skills to the limit to get it to this point.  I'm sure there are many improvements and additions that could be made :)
